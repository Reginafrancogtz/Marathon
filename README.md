# Marathon
The Marathon game is a type of interactive game where participants must answer a series of questions, usually general knowledge questions, within a limited time. In this project, the aim is to answer questions from three categories: musical, historical and geographical. Each correct answer allows you to advance to the next question, and the goal is to get as many correct answers as possible without making any mistakes. As players progress, the questions can become more challenging, adding an element of difficulty to the game. This type of game can be played both individually and in groups, and adapts to different formats, from a simple multiple-choice quiz to a more complex experience with thematic categories and progressive levels. Creating such a game is a great idea because it not only allows players to test their knowledge and memory, but also encourages friendly competition and learning. Furthermore, by implementing it in a programming language such as C++, a scoring system, timers and interactive design can be incorporated, providing an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.

Developing such a game in C++ is not only a great exercise to improve programming skills, but it also turns out to be a fun and dynamic experience. The interaction with the player, the possibility of adding custom difficulty levels or categories, and real-time competition can make the game very entertaining. In addition, it is a project that can be expanded and improved in various ways. For all these reasons, a Questions and Answers Marathon game not only represents a technical challenge in C++, but also an opportunity to create an interactive product that can offer hours of fun to players and, at the same time, be an educational project that covers programming logic.
