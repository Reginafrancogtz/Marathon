#MARATHON

**WHAT IS IT?**

A Marathon game is an interactive activity where participants answer a series of questions, usually related to a specific topic or general knowledge. These questions can be organized by difficulty levels and presented in various formats, such as multiple choice, true or false, fill-in-the-blank, or open-ended responses.
The game can be designed for individual play, group participation, or competitive modes. Often, it includes mechanisms to track scores, set time limits for answering, or incorporate features like rewards or level unlocking to make it more dynamic and engaging.

Common Features:
Variety of topics: History, science, general knowledge, entertainment, sports, etc.
Interactivity: Actively involves players in answering questions.
Reward systems: Points, levels, or bonuses for correct answers.
Game modes: Solo, local multiplayer, or online multiplayer.
Adaptable technology: Can be implemented as mobile apps, web platforms, or physical games.

**MARATHON IN THIS PROJECT** 

In the case of this project, we are looking to create a Marathon game with the following specifications. First, the questions will focus on two topics, musical culture and history, these questions will all be of the same difficulty. The game will be designed to be played individually and will have a mechanism that will track the player's score by awarding points if the answer (multiple choice) is correct. The game does not have any timer or function that establishes time limits, all this to make it more dynamic and attractive.

Purposes of the game:
The goal is to create an interactive game where a player can answer questions from different categories (in this case, music and history). The system should:
-Manage a player and their score.
-Display questions from various categories, with multiple-choice answers.
-Verify answers and update the player’s score.
-Differentiate between types of questions (e.g., music questions include hints about artists, albums, genres).

**WHAT IS IT USED FOR?**

A Marathon game is primarily used for entertainment, education, and skill development. It serves as a fun and engaging way to test knowledge on various topics, making it an effective tool for both casual learning and formal training. In educational contexts, it helps reinforce information retention by transforming the learning process into an interactive and enjoyable experience. For example, it can be used in schools, corporate training, or self-improvement platforms to teach concepts, assess progress, or prepare for exams. Additionally, Marathon games promote cognitive skills such as critical thinking, quick decision-making, and problem-solving under pressure. In the entertainment industry, they provide a competitive and social aspect, allowing friends or strangers to compete in knowledge-based challenges, fostering engagement and collaboration. Beyond personal enjoyment, these games are also used in marketing, where businesses create branded quizzes to increase customer interaction, gather feedback, or promote products in an interactive manner. Their versatility and adaptability make them valuable tools in education, entertainment, and even professional development.

**WHAT IS IT NOT USED FOR?**

A Marathon game is not typically used for tasks that require complex, real-time decision-making, such as those found in simulation software for engineering, medical procedures, or military operations. It is not intended for deep analytical processing or extensive problem-solving scenarios. Finally, they are not built for long-form storytelling or immersive experiences, which are better suited for role-playing games, novels, or films. In summary, while Marathon games are excellent for quick learning, entertainment, and knowledge testing, they are not meant for applications requiring deep analysis, physical skills, emotional therapy, or immersive narratives.
