PURPOSE OF THE GAME:
The goal is to create an interactive game where a player can answer questions from different categories (in this case, music and history). The system should:
-Manage a player and their score.
-Display questions from various categories, with multiple-choice answers.
-Verify answers and update the playerâ€™s score.
-Differentiate between types of questions (e.g., music questions include hints about artists, albums, genres).
